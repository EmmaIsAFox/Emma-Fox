## Bio
I have a B.S. in Ecology and Watershed management with a minor in soil science and a M.S. in Biology.
I am currently working as a biological science technician for USDA ARS on small grains gemplasm research. 

## What I'm Working On :test_tube:

* Improvement of Barley for Enhanced Productivity, Quality, and Stress Resistance
* Develop barley varieties with improved Fusarium head blight (FHB) resistance.
* Mapping FHB resistance and develop germplasm resistant to multiple diseases via marker-assisted selection.
